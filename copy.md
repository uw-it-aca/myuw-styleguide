# Getting Started

The goal of the pattern library is to be the definite design resource for anyone (designer/developer/project manager) working on a MyUW feature.

Inspired by the Material Design guidelines.

## Colors
MyUW's primary color palette consists out of UW purple and gold.

On top of this, there is a secondary color palette that is used when the primary color palette is not diverse enough. This secondary color palette is, for example, used to give a student's course cards unique colors.
