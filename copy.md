# Getting Started

The goal of the pattern library is to be the definite design resource for anyone (designer/developer/project manager) working on a MyUW feature.

Inspired by the Material Design guidelines.

# Style

## Colors
MyUW's primary color palette consists out of UW purple and gold.

On top of this, there is a secondary color palette that is used when the primary color palette is not diverse enough. This secondary color palette can, for example, be used to create unique course cards for all of a student's courses.

## Icons
The majority of MyUW's icons come from the [FontAwesome icon set](http://fontawesome.io/). 

## Typography
MyUW follows UW's branding and makes use of two typefaces: [Encode Sans](https://www.washington.edu/brand/graphic-elements/font-download/) and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).
